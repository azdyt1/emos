# Diversity-aware Deep Ranking Network for Recommendation

## Introduction
In  this  work, we aim to improve the recommendation diversity in the ranking stage, and propose a 
Diversity-aware Deep Ranking Network. DDRN is featured with three diversity-aware designs: 

- **Diversified Information Enhancement.** The Diversified Information Enhancement design brings the information of diversity-optimized item set 
from the matching stage, which makes up for the insufficient diversity of user interaction history.

- **Personalized Negative Sampling.** The Personalized Negative Sampling design adopts different negative sampling distributions 
to users on the basis of different diversity preference, distinguishing user's specific preference among similar items. 

- **Balanced Weighting of Interaction Category.** The Balanced Weighting of Interaction Category design eliminate bias between 
user interaction categories by a balanced weighting loss.

## Code
The DDRN.py is the core code of our proposed model DDRN, it shows the architecture of our model.

## Statement
According to the rules of our industrial partner, the external disclosure process of our code is very strict. 
The complete code and industrial data will be released after internal review.
